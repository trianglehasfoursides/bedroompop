**"MathRock"** is a _multi-tenant_, _distributed_, and _allegedly fault-tolerant_ database designed for developers who enjoy the adrenaline rush of debugging race conditions at 3 AM. Built on a foundation of overengineered abstractions and caffeine-induced hubris, MathRock promises _"blazingly fast"_ performance—though its only measurable speed so far is how quickly it segfaults when you glance away.

This database is named after the only genre of music complex enough to match its architecture: chaotic, technically impressive, and utterly incomprehensible to anyone outside the cult. Its _distributed consensus_ protocol, **"Polyrhythmic Paxos"**, synchronizes nodes using a mix of algorithmic precision and interpretive dance. _Multi-tenancy_ is enforced via **"Shredded Sharding"**, which isolates tenant data as effectively as a screen door on a submarine.

MathRock’s _fault tolerance_ is powered by **"Chaos-Driven Load Balancing"**—a feature that randomly kills nodes to keep you humble. For _high concurrency_, we offer **"Thread Riffs"**, a concurrency model that scales linearly until it doesn’t (spoiler: it never does).

**Why Choose MathRock?**

- **”It’s Alpha, Bro”**: Currently 20% complete, which means 80% of your time will be spent rewriting our code.
- **Quantum-Resistant Consensus**: Not because we need it, but because it sounds cool in investor pitches.
- **Guaranteed Existential Dread**: Every query log includes timestamps and philosophical quotes about entropy.
- **Documentation**: A single README.md that just says _"figure it out, loser"_ in Comic Sans.

**Warnings:**

- Do not deploy near production environments, sober adults, or regulatory bodies.
- **"Fault Tolerance"** currently tolerates one (1) fault: your expectations.
- The term _"distributed"_ refers to both the system architecture and the blame when it fails.

MathRock: Because sometimes, the only thing more unstable than your database is your life choices.
